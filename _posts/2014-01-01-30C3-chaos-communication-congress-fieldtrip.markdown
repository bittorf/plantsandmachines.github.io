We just returned from our very first fieldtrip. 
Last november we were invited to have a presentation about our project at the 30th chaos communication congress in Hamburg.
For this event we decided to build a brand new prototype, being more spa-like than the last one. And of course an appropriate website needed to be build to show and document our work. So that in case of a blackout on stage, people would still get what we'd wanted to say...


It was a rather thrilling time preparing for our trip but we manged to get the prototype and the website just ready.
The only question was how to get the prototype from Weimar to Hamburg. We decided that dex, bastian and I each take home one module over christmas to meet up for the congress in hamburg.
