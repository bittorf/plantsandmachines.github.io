				<p> An aquaponic system is an artifcial ecosystem that attempts to mimic part of
natures metabolic cycle. Through the combination of a set of carefully selected
organisms the system becomes nearly self-contained. 
<br/><br/>
Generally there are three diffrent kinds of living creatures in an aquaponics system, animals, micro-organisms and plants. 
The waste of the animals gets dissolved in water and is then filtered mechanically through the grow media. Microorganisms living inside the grow bed, initiate
a process called nitrification where ammonia and ammonium gets transformed to nitrite and
then nitrite is processed to nitrate. 
<br/><br/>
The plants in return rid the water of the
nitrate using it for their own metabolism. Afterwards the water is cleared of all
toxic substances and can be reused to provide a healthy environment for the aquatic animals
to live in.
<br/><br/>
Aquaponic is essentially the combination of a conventional
hydroculture with an aquaculture.
There are several advantages with this kind of a system. It reduces the amount
of external inputs. There is no need for fertilizer. There will be no wastewater
that has to be cleaned before releasing it back into environment.. Due to the closed na-
ture on an aquaponic system, there is almost no water loss. Water consumption
is reduced to around 10% of the amount needed for pure hydroponic systems.
The only factors that have to be considered are evaporation and the amount
of water that is transformed into plant tissue. 
<br/><br/>
Aquaponic systems offer high
resistance against weeds and pests of all kind. As for the plants, the water and
nutrient supply is always covered. This leads to an accelerated plant growth
while the actual space needed by a single plant is minimized. Some observa-
tions suggest, that plant growth doubles in speed and surface area per plant is
cut in halves. Another benefit of this kind of a system is that it is able to grow
protein in form of food-fish as well.</p>
