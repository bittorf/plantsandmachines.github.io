				The alpha-prototype consists of three transparent storage boxes made of polypropylene. [pic-001] The aquaculture resides in a 37x25x27 cm box at the bottom of the vertically stacked system. A submersible, self-sensing aquarium heater keeps the roughly 20 Liters of water at a temperature of around 26ÂºC. An aerator feeds an air stone inside the aquarium to ensure the right level of dissolved oxygen. A submersible pump is used for water transportation. The bottom of the box is covered with gravel suited for aquariums that has no apparent erosion changing the PH of the system. A lid covers the box.
The hydroculture sits on top of the bottom boxes lid. The dimensions are 37x25x17 cm. It is equipped with a water-sensor that measures the electrical resistance between two contacts. [pic-002] When there is no water near the sensor, the resistance is tending towards infinitive. As soon as water touches both of the contacts, resistance drops and the sensor goes to HIGH. The water-sensors vertical position defines the maximum water level inside the hydroculture while flooded. The grow bed is filled with inflated clay pebbles with a grain of 1-4 mm. Inside the grow bed is a perforated hose that connects to the pump through holes on the bottom of the hydroculture-box and the lid of the aquaculture. A drain is cut out of the bottom side of the box covered by a sponge that acts as a filter.
The top cover of the system is made out of the same kind of box used for the aquaculture. It rests on the hydroculture-box upside down so that the floor is facing upwards. The top case holds a digital temperature and humidity sensor [pic-003] and a 220 V AC, 60 W full spectrum fluorescent lamp. [pic-004] Above the lamp a vent releases excessive heat. On the side of the box two 80 mm fans facing to the outside of the system take care of regulating temperature and humidity.

Above the top cover rests a reflector shield built out of a spare lid, some cardboard and an emergency blanket to increase luminance efficacy.

All switchable actuators of the system are connected to relays. [pic-005] The pump and the light are triggered by a 2 channel machine tool relay board. The relays are capable of switching 240 V alternating current at up to 10 A with a 3-5 V direct current input on the coils. For safety reasons, switching and coil current are separated by an opto-coupler. The fans run on 12 V direct current and are connected to a 6 channel relay board. The aerator is not controlled by a relay, it is permanently switched on. The heater has temperature sensing capabilities and is able to decide on its own when to turn on and off to hold the preset temperature. It is not connected to a relay.
The relay boards are powered and controlled with an Arduino micro-controller. The Arduino is a open source hardware project from Italy and consists of an ATmega328 clocked at 16 MHz and with a memory of 32KB. It features 14 digital and 6 analogue in- and outputs. An ATmega16u2 acts as a serial to USB converter, killing the need for an extra FTDY-to-USB adapter. The Arduino comes with an integrated programmer for the integrated-circuit. Because the Arduino converges all these functions into a single, well documented and easy to use board, it's ideal for prototyping. The Arduino also provides 3.3 V DC, ground and a data line to each of the sensors. It is powered through an active 4 channel USB hub.
The hub also powers a credit-card-sized, open source computer called raspberryPi. It features an ARM processor running at 1 GHz and 512 MB RAM. The operating system used is an ARM ported version of Debian Wheezy, a Linux based system. RaspberryPi and Arduino are communicating over a serial connection through the USB-hub. The raspberryPi is connected to LAN with a USB-wifi-card.
All switching current comes out of an ATX power-supply-unit. The PSU is short-circuited in order to run without a computer main board and connected to a USB cup warmer that acts as a load in case all actuators of the system are turned off.
